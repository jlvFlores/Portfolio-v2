<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Portfolio-v2 <a name="about-project"></a>

**Portfolio-v2** is indeed a new version of my developer portfolio that I plan on updating with my newest acquired knowledge as a full-stack developer. The project is created with React and Redux, and it communicates with Firebase's Firestore through the use of APIs to retrieve and display the details of my previous projects, attributes, current resume, and the text in the paragraphs to allow for more customization of the website.
